0,0,0,0,1,How can we implement?
0,0,0,0,1,Where should the view be shown?
0,0,0,0,1,Which algorithm to choose?
0,0,0,0,1,How could we display a large graph more clearly?
0,0,0,0,1,How to create a context menu?
0,0,0,0,1,What configuration possibilities should users have?
1,0,0,0,0,The user could configure the classifier algorithm
1,0,0,0,0,Instead we could do the following thing.
1,0,0,0,0,This might be an option.
1,0,0,0,0,Alternatively we can implement it as that.
1,0,0,0,0,I would suggest to try to apply the observer pattern
1,0,0,0,0,This technology could also be used.
1,0,0,0,0,"We could apply a model view controller (MVC) design pattern."
0,1,0,0,0,This will improve the performance.
0,1,0,0,0,It might have a positive impact on the readability.
0,1,0,0,0,Less work
0,1,0,0,0,This is easier to implement and maintain.
0,1,0,0,0,The user experience will be improved.
0,1,0,0,0,Open-source MIT licensed
0,1,0,0,0,This will make it more easy in the future.
0,0,1,0,0,It might have a negative impact on performance.
0,0,1,0,0,Code becomes more complex
0,0,1,0,0,I think this may be a bit confusing to the user.
0,0,1,0,0,This is highly unusable.
0,0,1,0,0,The code will be less clear.
0,0,1,0,0,The documentation is bad.
0,0,1,0,0,Hard to implement.
0,0,0,1,0,I choose the first alternative.
0,0,0,1,0,We concluded that we implement it in that way.
0,0,0,1,0,Therefore we used the second implementation.
0,0,0,1,0,The decision was made to use a SVM.
0,0,0,1,0,We chose to use this framework.
0,0,0,1,0,We decided to allow the following configuration
0,0,0,1,0,I replaced WEKA/MEKA with the SMILE library!
0,0,0,0,0,I think he might be able to help you.
0,0,0,0,0,Ask her for advice.
0,0,0,0,0,I added a sequence diagram for the recommendation mechanism
0,0,0,0,0,"Here's a small screenshot of the current state."
0,0,0,0,0,Maybe we can talk about that tomorrow.
0,0,0,0,0,Thanks for updating the unit tests!
0,0,0,0,0,Please install a current version of the plug-in on the server and test whether it works there.
