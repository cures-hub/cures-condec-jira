0,1,0,0,0,Those Icons look great in treant.

1,0,0,0,0,We could replace the end tag by a line break.

1,0,0,0,0,This bug should be solved by changing to the latest Spring Scanner version.

1,0,0,0,0,"Currently, we check whether the user is authorized in many classes, e.g. in the REST classes and in the Servlets."

1,0,0,0,0,Create an AuthorizationManager class that it is used in the REST and servlet classes.

0,0,0,0,1,"Is it ok, if I combine these classes into ""MockUserManager""?"
0,0,0,1,0,Fixed by adding a boolean to velocity parameters.
0,0,0,0,1,I also have the problem that the knowledge types toggles seem to be deactivated although they are actually activated.
0,0,0,0,1,Should the tags also no longer pop up after a change or only at the opening of the page? 
0,1,0,0,0,It works on my local Jira instance.
0,0,0,0,0,I also installed the version on the server.

0,0,0,0,0,AJS.$(document).ready(function ());
0,0,0,0,0,"I already fixed this. "
0,0,0,0,1,This is a very strange behavior and its not yet determined what is causing this.
0,0,0,0,1,I think this happens because JIRA calls the code twice (why ever?).
0,0,0,0,1,"If the code is executed ""fast enough"" sequentially or parallel a sentence is added twice into the db, since the first insertion is not finished when the second one starts its consistency function."
1,0,0,0,0,A simple solution for this bug is to check the consistency after all sentences are inserted and delete possible duplicates
1,0,0,0,0,An alternate solution is to identify the problem why the first consistency check (in the ao method for inserting a sentence) fails.
0,0,1,0,0,This idea also does not work.
0,0,0,1,0,"Fix by adding a static counter that increases with every deletion and is called every second time."
0,0,0,0,1,"The problem is that ""somehow"" the generic links between sentences and issue are deleted."
0,0,0,0,1,Unfortunately there is no reason for these links to be deleted.
0,0,0,0,1,And there is no possibility for the user to delete a link without creating a new one.
0,0,0,0,1,The last time (so when I was hunting for this bug) a Java Heap Space exception occurred.
1,0,0,0,0,A workaround is a function that checks for every element if a valid link exists (no matter if the link is to a sentence or an issue).
0,0,0,1,0,Please remove all the webhook calls from the KnowledgeRest class and add them to the ActiveObjectStrategy class.

0,0,0,0,1,"The getKnowledgeType method returns an Enum instance, but we need a String for the AO database."
0,0,0,0,1,We cannot both ignore this method in the Entity interface and write a new one because one cannot overload the return type of methods.
