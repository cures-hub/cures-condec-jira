<h2>Link Recommendation and Duplicate Recognition</h2>
#set($linkRecommendationConfig = $project.getLinkSuggestionConfiguration())

<p>On this page, the rationale manager can configure the link recommendation and duplicate recognition feature.
This feature tries to identify related knowledge elements using the <b>context information</b> of knowledge elements.
The context information is calculated from the various <b>context information providers, i.e. link recommendation rules</b> listed below.</p>

<p>Every context information provider calculates a <var>ruleValue<sub>i</sub></var>.
For example, the textual similarity context information provider calculates a rule value based on the textual similarity of two knowledge elements. 
The more textual similar, the higher is the rule value.
Besides, every context information provider is assigned a <var>ruleWeight<sub>i</sub></var> to determine its importance for recommendation creation.

For every knowledge element that might be related to the selected element, a <var>recommendationScore</var> is calculated as follows:</p>

<p><b><code>recommendationScore = (&sum;<sup>N</sup> ruleValue<sub>i</sub> * ruleWeight<sub>i</sub> -&#12314;ruleWeight<sub>i</sub> < 1&#12315;ruleWeight<sub>i</sub>) / maxAchievableScore</code></b>, </p>

<p>where <var>N</var> is the number of enabled context information providers,</p>
<p><b><code>-&#12314;ruleWeight<sub>i</sub> < 1&#12315;ruleWeight<sub>i</sub></code></b> denotes that the substraction is only done for negative rule weights to reverse the effect,</p>
<p>and <var>maxAchievableScore</var> is the hypothetical best recommendation score to normalize the score between 0 and 1.</p>

<p>The <var>ruleWeight<sub>i</sub></var> can also be negative to reverse the effect of the rule.
For instance, for the timely coupling context information provider (<i>boost when element is timely coupled to the selected element</i>),
a negative rule weight means that elements that are not timely coupled are assigned a higher recommendation score.</p>

The link recommendations are sorted by their <var>recommendationScore</var>.

<p>A link to another knowledge element is only recommended if the <b><code>recommendationScore >= threshold</code></b> and 
if the link recommendation is under the <b>top-k recommendations</b>.</p>

The textual similarity context information provider is used to <b>identify duplicates</b>.
If the text is very similar, a link recommendation is marked as a potential duplicate.
