# Quality Checking

The ConDec Jira plugin offers the possibility to configure and check a **Definition of Done (DoD)** for the knowledge documentation.
The following **criteria of the DoD** are checked:
- the **decision coverage** (i.e. a type of rationale coverage) for every knowledge element
- criteria of the **intra-rationale completeness** for decision knowledge elements
- specific aspects (*is test file?*, *number of lines of code*) for code files
- the **quality of the directly linked knowledge elements** in the knowlegde graph, 
i.e. if a neighbor knowledge element of the checked element violates the DoD the checked element will also violate the DoD.
DoD violations are passed to neighbor elements in the knowlegde graph as a means of [nudging](nudging.md).

ConDec displays the result of the quality/DoD checking in the following ways:
- in a **quality check view** accessable from every knowledge element in the knowledge graph (see section below)
- using **[red text color](nudging.md) in knowledge graph views** if the DoD is violated. An explanation is given using a tooltip.
- in a **[just-in-time prompt](nudging.md)** that is shown during status changes (as automated quality checks integrated into the development workflow, e.g., when finishing a requirement)
- in the **[rationale backlog](rationale-backlog.md)**
- in a metric plot in the **[knowledge dashboard](dashboard.md)**
- in **[pull requests](https://github.com/cures-hub/cures-condec-bitbucket)** in the form of a **merge check**: 
For example, the developers can only accept a pull request if the decision coverage is high enough and 
if all the decision problems that are documented in a certain link distance from the changed code in the knowledge graph are solved.

## Quality Check View
The status of the quality check can be viewed continuously in the **quality check view**.
Developers can access the quality check view from the Jira issue view as well as from the rationale backlog and rationale overview.

The [color of the menu item](nudging.md) to access the quality check view is:
- green if all criteria of the DoD are fulfilled
- yellow if one or two criteria of the DoD are violated
- red if more than two criteria of the DoD are violated

The following screenshots show the quality check view for different selected knowledge elements.

*Rationale backlog showing the quality check results for the selected issue (=decision problem).
The issue violates the DoD criterion that at least one alternative need to be documented (this is a configurable criterion, see below).*

![Rationale backlog showing the quality check results for the selected issue](../screenshots/rationale_backlog_quality_check_issue_linked_knowledge_fails.png)

*Rationale backlog showing the quality check results for the selected issue. 
The issue fulfills the criteria of the DoD but the linked alternatives violate the DoD.*

![Rationale backlog showing the quality check results for the selected code file](../screenshots/rationale_backlog_quality_check_code.png)

*Rationale backlog showing the quality check results for the selected code file.
The code file violates the DoD criterion that at least 2 decisions need to be reachable in the knowledge graph within a link distance (number of hops) of 3.*

![Decision overview showing the quality check results for the selected decision](../screenshots/quality_check_view_decision_ok.png)

*Decision overview showing the quality check results for the selected decision.
Both the decision and the knowledge elements linked to the decision fulfill the DoD.*

![Alternative overview showing the quality check results for the selected alternative](../screenshots/quality_check_view_decision_violation.png)

*Alternative overview showing the quality check results for the selected alternative.
The alternative violates the DoD criterion that at least one argument needs to be documented.*

*Jira issue view showing the quality check results for the selected epic. 
Both the epic and the knowledge elements linked to the epic fulfill the DoD.*

## Configuration
The rationale manager can configure the criteria for the DoD.

## Design Details
The following class diagram gives an overview of relevant backend classes for this feature.
The *DefinitionOfDone* stores the rules that are configured for the decision knowledge project’s rationale documentation to be considered complete. 
The *DefinitionOfDone* is configured separately for each *DecisionKnowledgeProject*, and is checked using the *DefinitionOfDoneChecker*. 
The *DefinitionOfDoneChecker* checks if the *DefinitionOfDone* is fulfilled for a *KnowledgeElement*. 
To do this, it uses the *KnowledgeType* of the element to fetch the corresponding inheritor of the abstract *KnowledgeElementCheck* class. 
An interface to the frontend is provided through the REST endpoints in the class *DefinitionOfDoneCheckingRest*.
