# Quality Checking

The ConDec Jira plugin offers the possibility to configure a **Definition of Done (DoD)** for decision knowledge.
The definition of done is checked and the status of the quality can be viewed continuously in the Quality Check tab.

ConDec supports the fulfillment of the definition of done with the help of a [dashboard](dashboard.md) and automated quality checks integrated into the development workflow, e.g., when finishing a requirement. 
For example, the developer can only finish the log-in requirement if all the decision problems that are documented in a certain link distance in the knowledge graph are solved.
