# Decision Grouping

The ConDec Jira plugin enables to group decisions and related knowledge elements.
Developers can group decisions according to predefined levels (high, medium, and realization).
They can also define custom groups (e.g. UI, process, design, requirements).
Levels and custom groups can be assigned using the context menu on a specific knowledge element in a knowledge graph view.

Developers and other stakeholders can filter for decision levels and groups, for example, if they only want to see decisions for a software component (here git).
