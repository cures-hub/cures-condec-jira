# Decision Grouping

The ConDec Jira plugin enables to **group decisions and related knowledge elements**.
Developers can group decisions according to predefined **levels (high, medium, and realization)**.
They can also define **custom groups (e.g. UI, process, design, requirements, architecture, testing, ...)**.

Major differences between ConDec's decision grouping and the Jira label mechanism are:
- Decision knowledge elements (in particular, decision problems and solution options) from **[various documentation locations](documentation.md)** 
(e.g. documented in comments and commit messages) can be gathered in decision groups.
For example, developers can access a UI decision documented in code from a [knowledge graph view](knowledge-visualization.md) in Jira through decision group filtering.
- The **group assignment is inherited** within the decision knowledge. 
For example, if a developer assigns a decision to the decision group *process*, the linked decision problem and alternatives will inherit this group.

We use the following definition for decision levels by [van der Ven and Bosch (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-39031-9_15):
1. *High level decisions* affect the whole product, altough they are not necessarily always the decisions that are debated 
or thought through the most. 
Often, people that are not involved in the realization of the project (e.g. management or enterprise architects) heavily affect these decisions. 
Typical examples of high-level decisions are the choice to adopt an architectural style, 
use a programming language, application server, or specific large (COTS) components.
Changing these decisions typically has a huge impact.
2. *Medium level decisions* involve the selection of specific components or frameworks, 
or describe how specific components map to each other according to specific architectural patterns. 
These decisions are often debated in the architecture and development teams and are evaluated, changed and discarded as needed. 
They have a high impact on the (nonfunctional) properties of the product and are relatively expensive to change.
3. *Realization level decisions* involve the structure of the code, the location of specific responsibilities (e.g. design patterns), 
or the usage of specific APIs. 
These decisions are relatively easy to change, and have relative low impact on the properties of the system.

## Assignment and Filtering
Levels and custom groups can be assigned using the context menu on a specific knowledge element in a knowledge graph view.

Developers (and other stakeholders) can **filter for decision levels and groups**, for example, if they only want to see decisions for the UI or process decisions.

## Decision Grouping as a Definition of Done Criterion
The rationale manager can enforce that developers assign decision problems and solution options to decision levels and groups by 
making the **assignment of decision levels and groups a [definition of done (DoD)](quality-checking.md) criterion**.
If a decision problem or solution option is not assigned to a decision level and decision, the quality check fails and 
the respective element is colored in red in the knowledge graph views as means of [nudging](nudging.md).
The **quality check view and the tooltip explain why the DoD is fulfilled or violated**.

![Decision problem that fullfills the DoD since a decision level (Medium) and decision group (UI) is assigned to it.](../screenshots/decision_grouping_dod_fulfilled.png)

*Decision problem that fullfills the DoD since a decision level (Medium) and decision group (UI) is assigned to it.*

![Decision problem that violates the DoD since no decision level and no custom decision group is assigned to it.](../screenshots/decision_grouping_dod_violated.png)

*Decision problem that violates the DoD since no decision level and no custom decision group is assigned to it.
Developers can see an explanation for the DoD violation in the quality check view and in the tooltip.*

![Decision problem that violates the DoD since only a decision level but no custom decision group is assigned to it.](../screenshots/decision_grouping_dod_violated_level_only.png)

*Decision problem that violates the DoD since only a decision level but no custom decision group is assigned to it.*

## Decision Grouping Overview and Dashboard
ConDec offers an **overview for the decision levels and decision groups** assigned in a project.
In this overview, the developers can **rename and delete decision groups** via a context menu on group names.
They can also navigate to the details of the decisions and change the decision group/level assignment via a context menu on the decisions.

ConDec also offers a **[dashboard item for decision levels and decision groups](dashboard.md)**.
