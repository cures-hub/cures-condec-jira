# Link Recommendation and Duplicate Recognition

The ConDec Jira plug-in offers a feature that **recommends new links between knowledge elements** and 
that tries to **identify duplicated knowledge elements**.
In particular, the feature should support developers in
1. **decision making through identifying related decision problems and solution options** documented by others or in the past (to prevent duplicated decision making),
2. **creating a completely and correctly linked knowledge documentation** that can be exploited e.g. during **[change impact analysis]** (to detect impacts, side, and ripple effects of changes), and
3. general knowledge sharing and **knowledge exploitation**, since the link recommendation confronts the developers with related documented knowledge, which is not linked in the knowledge graph.

## Link Recommendations Within the Knowledge Graph Views
Developers can see the link recommendations directly in the [knowledge graph views].
The respective nodes are highlighted and there is a dedicated *recommended* link type.
Developers can use the filter possibilities in [knowledge graph views] to inspect the context of the recommended elements.
Besides, the recommended elements can be included in [change impact analysis].

Besides, ConDec offers a dedicated view for link recommendation and duplicate recognition which developers can access as follows:
1. Developers can access the view from every Jira issue, i.e. it is included in the Jira issue view.
2. Developers can access the view from the knowledge view for the project.

Developers can **accept (link) or discard** the recommendations.
The discarding can be undone.

## Calculation of the Recommendation Score
This feature tries to identify related knowledge elements using the **context information** of knowledge elements.
The context information is calculated from the following **context information providers, i.e. link recommendation rules**:

1. Recommend elements that are **textual similar** to the source element
2. Recommend elements that are **timely coupled** to the source element
3. Recommend elements that have the **same author** as the source element
4. Recommend elements that are **decision problems**
5. Recommend elements that are **solution options**
6. Recommend elements that are assigned to the **same decision group** as the source element
7. Recommend elements that are assigned to the **same component** as the source element
8. Recommend elements that can be **traced** to the source element (but are not directly linked)
9. Recommend elements that are the same knowledge type as the source element
10. Recommend elements that are included in the **same sprint**

Every context information provider calculates a <code>ruleValue<sub>i</sub></code>.
For example, the textual similarity context information provider calculates a rule value based on the textual similarity of two knowledge elements. 
The more similar the texts are, the higher is the rule value for this context information provider.
Besides, every context information provider is assigned a <code>ruleWeight<sub>i</sub></code> to determine its importance for recommendation creation.

The <code>ruleWeight<sub>i</sub></code> can also be negative to reverse the effect of the rule.
For instance, for the time context information provider (*recommend elements that are timely coupled to the source element*),
a negative rule weight means that elements that are not timely coupled are more likely to be recommended.

For every knowledge element that might be related to the selected element, a `recommendationScore` is calculated as follows:

<code>recommendationScore = (&sum;<sup>N</sup> ruleValue<sub>i</sub> * ruleWeight<sub>i</sub> -&#12314;ruleWeight<sub>i</sub> < 1&#12315;ruleWeight<sub>i</sub>) / maxAchievableScore</code>

where `N` is the number of enabled context information providers,
<code>-&#12314;ruleWeight<sub>i</sub> < 1&#12315;ruleWeight<sub>i</sub></code> denotes that the subtraction is only done for negative rule weights to reverse the effect,
and `maxAchievableScore` is the hypothetical best score to normalize the recommendation score between 0 and 1.

The `recommendationScore` represents the predicted relevance of a recommendation, i.e., how likely the developers accept the recommendation.
The link recommendations are sorted by their `recommendationScore` to rank the recommendations.
The best (top-k) recommendations are determined.

A link to another knowledge element is only recommended if the `recommendationScore >= threshold` and 
if the link recommendation is under the **top-k recommendations**.

Many of the link recommendation rules (i.e. context information providers) are also used during **[change impact analysis]**
as **change propagation rules**.

Developers can see an **explanation for the score of each recommendation** (similar to the explanations during [change impact analysis] and [decision guidance]).

## Duplicate Recognition
The textual similarity context information provider is used to **identify duplicates**.
If the text is very similar, a link recommendation is marked as a potential duplicate.

Developers and the rationale manager can inspect the potential duplicates in the [knowledge graph views](knowledge-visualization.md), 
e.g. in the [node-link diagram](../screenshots/link_recommendation_duplicates_node_link_diagram.png) or in the [indented outline](../screenshots/link_recommendation_duplicates_indented_outline.png).

Directly and transitively linked decision problems (issues) and solution options (alternatives) are shown that match the "export" filter string. 
The alternatives are duplicated.*

## Nudging Mechanisms
ConDec uses the following **[nudging mechanisms](nudging.md)** to support the usage of the link recommendation and duplicate recognition feature:

- **Ambient feedback:** The colored menu item indicates whether action is needed, i.e., 
whether there are recommendations that were not yet accepted or discarded by the developers.
- **Just-in-time prompt:** ConDec shows a [just-in-time prompt](../screenshots/nudging_prompt.png) to the developers when they change the state of a Jira issue.
Similar to the ambient feedback nudge, the just-in-time prompt indicates whether action is needed.

## Configuration
The rationale manager can configure the **default parameters** for the link recommendation, in particular, the
1. maximum number of recommendations (**top-k**), 
2. the **threshold**, and 
3. **default rules (context information providers) and their weights** (similar as for [change impact analysis]). 

Furthermore, the developer can change the default values during the usage of the link recommendation.

## Design Details
The following class diagram gives an overview of relevant backend classes for this feature.
The class *LinkRecommendationRest* provides the interface to the frontend. 
The class *LinkRecommendationConfiguration* stores the configuration information for a project. 
The class *ContextInformation* creates *LinkRecommendation*s and detects duplicates based on the context information of *KnowledgeElement*s.
It is decorated with the *ContextInformationProvider*s, such as the *TextualSimilarityContextInformationProvider* or *TimeContextInformationProvider*.
*LinkRecommendation*s have a *RecommendationScore* and inherit from the class *Link*, which means that they have source and target elements, as well as a *LinkType* (recommended).
The *RecommendationType* determines the type of the recommendation.
