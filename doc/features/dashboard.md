# Knowledge Dashboard

ConDec supports decision knowledge sharing and collaborative decision making using a rationale backlog and in meeting agendas.

The dashboard shows metrics regarding the 
- intra-rationale completeness (e.g., *are there arguments for the decisions?*), 
- the rationale coverage of requirements and code (e.g., *how many decisions are documented for a requirement?*), 
- the rationale-to-artifact traceability (e.g., *is it possible to navigate to the requirements affected by a decision?*), and 
- the feature branch quality regarding the rationale documentation.

## Design Details
The following class diagram gives an overview of relevant backend classes for the dashboard.
